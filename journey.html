      <div class="content content1"><h4>How it started...</h4><p>In fifth grade, our school had some Apple IIe's that supported vigorous play of Oregon Trail. I fondly remember the day my dad bought our first Pentium II 200Mhz desktop computer. I demonstrated an affinity for numerical, procedural, and methodical thinking from an early age. I took one computer science class in 9th grade that I quite enjoyed. (Thanks, Mr. Brown.) </p>
      <p>However, as school went on, all my left-brain capacity was overwhelmed by right-brain endeavors. I performed in school plays and musicals, toured and competed with high school and college <em>a cappella</em> groups, and eventually chose to pursue a performing career in New York City.</p>
      <p>Performing fulfilled me and led me to discover my authentic self more than I ever realized I needed. I discovered the value of vulnerability, met hundreds of brilliant artists and talents, and learned the beauty that can be achieved by a talented team working toward a common goal.</p> 
      <p>But the unpredictability, the lack of consistent progress, the lack of control over my career, and the global pandemic that affected everything everywhere (How could we forget?) -- all these struggles -- caused me to seek a new path and new goals.</p>
      <p>Years of searching followed. I researched and considered purusing careers in massage therapy, green energy, writing, proofreading, hospitality, education, social psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, fitness, nutrition, sports management ... and the list goes on.</p>
      <p>But I continually returned to the allure of software and web development. There are the obvious factors like the expected high job growth, salary, and security in the industry over the next 20-30 years. As someone who lived a somewhat nomadic existence, I also loved the idea of being able to work from anywhere. And after years of primarily right-brained work, I realized I always felt more comfortable in my left-brain. While web and software development are in no way exclusively left-brained disciplines, I was excited to use the left brain more often than I usually had as a performer.</p> 
      <p>Perhaps more importantly, I also realized I'd always enjoyed building things with a computer: spreadsheets, games, graphic/video design projects, Garageband music, giant Civilization empires, even complex Word documents with stuff like macros and mail-merges. Coding was an extension and an expansion of that joy. Studying coding would give me additional tools to build fun and useful projects with a computer.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content content2"><h4>How it's going...</h4>
      <p>I gave coding a first pass in 2016-17. Every day for about 4 months, I'd put in 1-2 hours on codeacademy and other similar tutorial sites, learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Eventually, I ran out of steam, hitting a wall when I realized I needed either a mentor, teacher, boot camp, or otherwise more serious commitment to build the skill. At the time, I wasn't willing and/or able to take any of those leaps.</p>
      <p>Cut to June 2020. It became clear that the live performing industry was going to be shut down for a very long time, due to the Coronavirus pandemic. I'd long since stopped competing very hard for performing jobs anyway. Instead I'd been enjoying the security and comfort of a solid annual contract to perform at Hong Kong Disneyland during the Christmas holiday season every year since 2016. However, not knowing whether this contract would be available in 2020, given the pandemic, I decided I wanted to develop a new, employable skill as quickly as I could.</p>
      <p>Returning once again to coding as the most ideal skill to pursue, I discovered The Odin Project, an absolute treasure of a resource: a complete coding curriculum designed to teach you the development skills you need to become employable as a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer -- <strong><em>at no cost to you</em></strong>.</p>
      <p>I put in about 3 months of 4-8 hour days studying through The Odin Project's syllabus, realizing I already had a decent foundation in HTML/CSS/JS stored away in my brain from my previous foray into coding. However, this time, I was more focused and determined to reach that critical skill level of "employability."</p>
      <p>Then, somewhat unbelievably, I received another contract to perform at Hong Kong Disneyland, despite the ongoing pandemic. It required an intense series of requirements to be cleared for entry from the US, but I made it. (I also built an information site for my Disney performing colleagues using my growing web development skills!) However, this performing gig required nearly all of my time and focus once I had arrived in Hong Kong. As a result, I didn't have the energy or time to maintain my coding study during the three-month-long contract.</p>
      <p>Once I had completed that contract in January of 2021, I was able to resume my coding journey. By this point, I had moved into The Odin Project's course on the back-end language Ruby. Progress was inconsistent, and staying motivated was challenging. I began to feel overwhelmed by how much there was to learn, and Impostor Syndrome set in as I became convinced that I was not learning fast enough or well enough to ever be able to make a career out of this skill.</p>
      <p>Another coding study hiatus followed during May/June of 2021. Once again I was close to giving up on coding completely. Once again I was considering whether I should just try to find something else to do with my life. Once again I was expecting that I'd land another contract to perform at Hong Kong Disneyland that would sustain me for another year.</p>
      <p>Then, we received the news that our contract to perform during the Christmas season in Hong Kong was not being renewed for 2021, or the foreseeable future. The creative team had decided on a new Christmas concept and wanted an entirely new cast to match it. Whoa. While I knew this decision was a possibility, I definitely did not expect it. </p>
      <p>The news was massively disorienting. For five years, the most interesting thing about me was that I was an American who worked in Hong Kong for three months each year and took epic vacations within Southeast Asia and Australia when those contracts were complete. It felt like my very identity was in flux without this contract. I realized quickly that I would have to move on. This Hong Kong chapter was amazing, but it was time to turn the page.</p>
      <p>So now, in mid-July 2021, I have a new purpose as a I return once again to coding. I'm building a new me and hoping that I can help others by building cool stuff for them with my computer.</p>

      <div class="content content3"><h4>Where it's headed...</h4><p>I'm honestly still defining my goals for this career path. But so far, a few stand out. First and foremost, I want to acquire enough skill as a developer that I can earn a basic salary in the field.</p> 
      <p>I still have much to learn, so that is the other ongoing goal at the moment. I know the basics of HTML/CSS/Javascript, and I'm more than halfway through The Odin Project's course on Ruby. At this point I intend to keep working through The Odin Project's syllabus. And soon, I'd like to begin applying for junior developer-level positions.</p>
      <p>Hopefully my journey will be long and fruitful. Thanks for reading about how it's gone so far and my hopes for its future! Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me with messages of support or potential job opportunities!</p>
