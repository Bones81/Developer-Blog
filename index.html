      <p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. And in the case of someone who's toyed with the idea of jumping off the entertainment ship for several years and has now spent parts of multiple years dabbling in the coding arts--the journey also begins with several fits and starts. After three months of daily coding study here, long hiatuses (hiati?), another three months there, and occasional all-consuming performing jobs that interrupt my progress, the time may have finally come to commit more deeply to developing the web of skills one seems to require to have a career as a web developer. I hope that this blog, which I have created with my thus-far-learned skills (and which is very much a work-in-progress), will enable me to stay accountable and motivated.</p>
      <p>Getting this basic layout/structure up and running has taken me the better part of 6 hours. Is that too much time to have spent on this? I always wonder and fear that, even with what I have learned, I am just too slow a coder to be an asset to a company. Impostor Syndrome in full effect.</p>
      <p>We'll work on that.</p>

      <p>Almost as if on cue, no sooner did I finish the first blog entry of this page that represents my commitment to a new era of life than <span>my new office chair arrived </span>üòù, an item chosen to support my health in a discipline that will require me to sit for many hours while I code.</p>
      <p>Honestly, I may have chosen too cozy a chair. I could fall asleep right noaiafma;adddddddddddddd...</p>
