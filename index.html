        <p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. And in the case of someone who's toyed with the idea of jumping off the entertainment ship for several years and has now spent parts of multiple years dabbling in the coding arts--the journey also begins with several fits and starts. After three months of daily coding study here, long hiatuses (hiati?), another three months there, and occasional all-consuming performing jobs that interrupt my progress, the time may have finally come to commit more deeply to developing the web of skills one seems to require to have a career as a web developer. I hope that this blog, which I have created with my thus-far-learned skills (and which is very much a work-in-progress), will enable me to stay accountable and motivated.</p>
        <p>Getting this basic layout/structure up and running has taken me the better part of 6 hours. Is that too much time to have spent on this? I always wonder and fear that, even with what I have learned, I am just too slow a coder to be an asset to a company. Impostor Syndrome in full effect.</p>
        <p>We'll work on that.</p>

        <p>Almost as if on cue, no sooner did I finish the first blog entry of this page that represents my commitment to a new era of life than <span>my new office chair arrived </span>üòù, an item chosen to support my health in a discipline that will require me to sit for many hours while I code.</p>
        <p>Honestly, I may have chosen too cozy a chair. I could fall asleep right noaiafma;adddddddddddddd...</p>

        <p>The chair is already paying huge dividends, as I have been quite productive (and comfortable) today, adding the About and Journey Pages, while also tweaking the stylings a bit to look (hopefully) a little more pleasing to the eye.</p>
        <p>I'm realizing just how revealing and useful it can be to have a blog or journal. But, as I've always known, if you let me talk, I often have so much to say that I run the risk of boring people with tedious details. Fortunately, this blog is mostly for me alone, even though it is publicly available through my Github Pages. So, for the time being, I will try to use it to document this journey.</p>

        <p>I've continued studying over the past two weeks, but I moved on to other exercises in doing so. As a result, this is my first new blog post since July 13. I have continued reviewing the fundamentals of CSS and moved on to JavaScript fundamentals and review. Because I have studied this material before, it's going reasonably quickly when I am able to devote the hours to study. Life (and horrific old NYC apartment plumbing) does get in the way, at times. </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, I do intend to continue using this blog, even if only as a personal journal of this transition to developer. But I also started toying with the idea of turning this into my first portfolio site, as well. So the <a href="./about.html">About</a> page now includes links to some of my earliest projects that are on GitHub. It all still feels so basic. Can't wait to learn and (more importantly) get comfortable working on more complex projects!</p>
        <p>Seems like the rhythm of an aspiring developer is to be doing fine, moving along at an acceptable pace, only to run into numerous brick walls of frustration and ignorance of how to code your way through a problem. These brick walls seemingly stop your progress cold and deal devastating blows to your confidence, mostly because you just don't know how long it will take to solve your issue. Often the answer is something you couldn't have known because you haven't learned it yet. Just as often the answer is some tiny detail you missed or forgot about in executing your code. Both answers are obnoxious, because either way, you feel like you've wasted a bunch of time just to resolve a single piece of code, and whatever momentum you had on the project is dissolved.</p>
        <p>Still getting comfortable with this kind of workflow. I'm hoping the brick walls will soften eventually. </p>
